All character sheets for this campaign are going to be kept on [DiceCloud](https://dicecloud.com/). I'm totally fine if you use a print-out during play, especially for in-person sessions, but please make sure to keep your online character sheet up to date with all your info, inventory, and abilities since parties and GMs are fluid. That way everything will be kept nice and organized in between play.

>[!note] DiceCloud Setup
>In order to have DiceCloud work for our DnD campaign, there will be a couple of edits that we'll need to make in advance of creating our characters depending on the version of 5e that we end up playing with. **This will all be gone over in Session 0 if you feel overwhelmed or don't want to look too into the tool before meeting**

| **Game Version** | Community Libraries Added                                | Libraries Disabled at Creation |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 5e 2014          | - Libraries Of Vexus (5e2014)<br>- Official LoV Homebrew | - DiceCloud 5th Edition SRD    |
| 5e 2024          | - Libraries Of Vexus (5e2024)                            | - DiceCloud 5th Edition SRD    |

Once you get setup with the right libraries for either game system, the ***Build*** tab of your character sheet will have a little tutorial to walk through getting your character built and teaching a bit about how to use the sheet. *This will all be covered when we meet to build characters together at Session 0*. Now for the more fun part...

## Building Your Story
The world of [[Lumeria]] was plunged into chaos with [[Nightfall]] and the manifestation of the [[Nyxwraiths]]. Whether you were born and raised in the stronghold of academia that is [[Calomir]] - maybe as a student at [[The Grand Luminarium]] or an orphan raised on the streets - or someone that just happened to be passing through when the calamity occurred, something is pulling you outward now.

The Hold, though packed tight, is safe. So the first question that I pose to you and your newly-formed character is this: **Why are you leaving the only safe place in the world to brave the dark?**

This can be as noble as seeking a loved one stranded in your hometown, or as callous as seeing the expedition as a way to gain influence in a world that would never have given you the opportunity to otherwise. The choice is yours *(as long as it's not totally a Murder-hobo... we are still playing a group game - though budding rivalries between PC's is encouraged!)*

>[!alert] Some More Character Inspiration
> Stylistically, [[Calomir]] is as a beacon of artifice and industry. Life here is divided:
>- The upper terraces where old families preserve their curated refinement
>- The enclaves of nature-devotees who cultivate gardens of memory in a sea of buildings reaching ever-higher
>- The dense, hard-working streets where most people live amid clattering workshops and spell-rigged machinery. These groups share the same city but understand each other poorly. It’s the only world they’ve ever known and the only one still standing.
