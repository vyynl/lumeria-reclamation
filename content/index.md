Lumeria is a world recently swallowed by a Calamity known as [[Nightfall]]. When the sun's divine aspect, [[Sael]], disappeared and light collapsed. Here is where you join the story. As civilization retreated to its only existing sanctuary of [[Calomir]], you have decided to answer the call of the newly-created [[Duskrunner Guild]]: a collection of explorers, scholars, and mercenaries who have chosen to carry the dying embers of the Light into the [[Shadow-Wastes]] for one reason or another. You have heard the call and answered as a #Spear, one of the few with a direct connection to [[The Aether]] allowing you to draw on its power to manipulate the material world.

Though your reasons for setting out are yours and yours alone, you shall play a vital role in the story of the world clawing back from the brink of annihilation.

>[!tip] The Frontier
>This campaign begins at [[Emberwatch]], a modest foothold in the [[Shadow-Wastes]] that will serve as your home base. Though things may seem dire at first, your successes through #Expedition will play a vital role in developing this flickering candle into a roaring bonfire.

## Tone of Play
Lumeria is bleak, but not hopeless. The night is cruel, but the people are not. Scenes may touch on fear, loss, or isolation, but the story is about endurance and rebuilding rather than despair. **The world is dangerous** and the potential for death looms around every bend...

>[!info] Player Safety
>I take player safety very seriously.

>Any player may pause or redirect a scene without justification.
>
>Please respect each others boundaries, keep chat kind, and remember: we're all here to tell a story together, not to test comfort and make people want to stop playing.

## The West Marches Format
Unlike more traditional D&D campaigns, **Lumeria: Reclamation** operates as a *West Marches* living world. There are no fixed parties or permanent GMs. The Guild's strength lies in its flexibility; Spears keep tabs on the quest board and choose where to strike, when to venture out, and with whom.
### How It Works
- **Player-Driven Play:** Sessions happen because players choose a lead and organize an #Expedition to tackle it. You and other Spears select a quest from the `#quest-board` channel on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1425841599945904240/1426217591294132284) and propose a new session for players to join with the `/new session` command.
- **Self-Contained Sessions:** Every expedition starts and ends within a single session. Outcomes feed back into the real world record and influence both how the Guild and overall world react in response.
- **Rotating Parties and GMs:** The Guild is fluid. Groups change, and any player may eventually create additional characters or choose to take up the mantle of GM.
- **Schedule Rule:** Sessions must be scheduled **at least 3 days in advance** to give GMs and players time to prepare. #Aegis (the guild's support bot) will handle event postings and automate registration.

>[!tip] Recording the Reclamation
>The Guild's archives grow only through the Spears who brave the dark. Every expedition generates a thread in the `#session-journal` channel. These serve as the official records of what occurred, what was discovered, and who returned.
>
>Players are responsible for keeping the world's map and campaign history updated. Maps, discoveries, and reports are community-built: the Guild's scribes are whoever picks up the pen.
>
>**Any player who posts a session summary or keeps notes/an updated map in the expedition's thread will receive a 10% experience bonus for that session.**
>
>**Accuracy and clarity matter more than your prose. Please don't use ChatGPT when record-keeping, and feel free to have your notes be in or out of character!**

## A Different Kind of Campaign
The in-person/online sessions for this campaign are generally going to lean more heavily into **mechanical** play at the table due to the necessity of having every expedition cleanly concluded at the end of each self-contained adventure. That being said, there is still plenty of room for RP in this world. The true life of this campaign will not only come from what happens at the table, but from **what your Characters do outside the table at camp.**

Allow for friendly rivalries to form and for a little bit of competitiveness happen *(as long as all parties remain comfortable and consenting)*. Your characters may come and go, but the Guild endures. Every expedition embarked on or vote cast in the weekly quartermaster poll works to push back the dark.

>[!danger] The Reclamation Never Sleeps
>Time is ever-flowing. Just as the Guild develops weekly, so does the rest of the world, whether the Spears are watching or not...

## Becoming a GM
The Reclamation is at its strongest when there is not only a large active roster of Characters, but also a large active roster of GMs. If you've ever thought about GMing (or maybe a particular expedition is waiting and nobody else seems to be available), this campaign is built to make it possible and as easy as possible to jump into.

- Message `@Guildmaster` on the Discord server to express your interest.
- You'll then get setup to receive the `@GM` role, access to private prep channels, and shared templates/materials for building for your first session in Lumeria.
- New GMs are encouraged to start small and ask for help if feeling lost or overwhelmed.

>[!Success] A Safe Place to Learn
>You don't need to have any past experience to get started. You'll have tons of guidance, tools, and support from other experienced GMs in the Guild. Every #Expedition adds to the world.
>
>If you ever run a session and feel unsafe, send me a private message and I'll do whatever is necessary to ensure that the campaign remains a safe and open place for new players and GMs alike to get engaged with the game
