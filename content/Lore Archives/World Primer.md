When [[Nightfall]] struck, a world at one point in balance became unstable. The sun vanished, the stars froze, and the boundaries between realities have frayed. In the moments since, Light has become the measure of life itself. The darker the way ahead grows, the closer the world bends toward ruin.

# The State of the World
The collapse was swift. Entire nations vanished when the light went out.  

The geography of the world is still recognizable, but its rules are not. The dark reshapes what it touches: forests knot into spirals, rivers harden into mirrored glass, and cities crumble beneath skies that no longer age.  

Only [[Calomir]] endures, its false sun burning above the city like a defiant star. Beyond its glow lies nothing mapped, nothing safe, and nothing certain.

# The Nature of Light
Light has become the symbol of life itself. The [[Nyxwraiths]], manifest shadows born of [[Nightfall]], cannot bear it.  

Every expedition carries lightstones, lanterns, or spells to hold the dark at bay, yet every flame is borrowed time. When the last light fades, the world bends inward, swallowing sound and color until only gray remains.

The scholars of [[The Grand Luminarium]] has imparted the [[Duskrunner Guild]] with artifice to hold the shadows at bay. But where one danger is averted, another may show its face...

# Echoes and the Aether


The Calamity did not just extinguish the sun—it tore the veil between reality and its reflection.  
The **Aether**, once a silent mirror of will and emotion, now bleeds into the physical world. Thought shapes matter, fear breeds monsters, and places heavy with memory twist themselves to match it.

Those who wield magic are touching that reflection directly. Every act leaves a residue—an **Echo**—a trace of intent that may grow into something with its own desires. The more will poured into the Aether, the more it remembers.

# The Frontier Mandate
Calomir’s false sun is stable for now, but its reach ends a few miles beyond the city walls.  
Supplies are dwindling. The world beyond still holds the resources, relics, and knowledge needed to keep civilization burning.  
The newly founded **Reclamation Effort** sends small expeditions into the wastes—not armies, just volunteers, scholars, and survivors willing to test the dark.  

Their task is not to rebuild the world, only to see if it still exists.  
Camps like **Dawnpoint** mark the furthest sparks of that effort—makeshift beacons surrounded by infinite night.
